* Name Resolution
------------------
* DNS
---------
-> MAC address - 48-bit binary numbers - written out in 6 grouping of 2 hexadecimal digits;
-> Remembering numbers is a tedious task than words.

-> DNS - Domain Name System - A global and highly distributed network service that resolves strings of letters into IP addresses for you.

-> Example for a weather website - IP address - 184.29.131.121 while the Domain name is - www.Weather.com - easier to remember the domain name;
-> The IP address for a domain name can also change all the time - in case of administrative changes, movements of the data centers;
-> The Domain name - The term we use for something that can be resolved by DNS;
-> DNS provides geographical data utlilty by enabling clients to gather data from servers that are collated, New Delhi server -> New Delhi, New york -> New York clients; Cause of the global structure DNS lets organizations decide if youre in the region resolve the domain name to this IP.


* Name Resolution
-------------------
-> The many steps of Name Resolution
-------------------------------------
 Name Resolution - The process of using a DNS system to convert Domain names into IP addresses; 
 - MAC address are hoardcoded to the hardware components;
 
* 4 Things that must be configured for a host to operate on a network in an expected way in standard modern networking are:
---------------------
 1. IP address
 2. Subnet mask
 3. Gateway for a host
 4. DNS server
 
 * 5 types of DNS servers:
 ----------------------------
 1. Caching name servers - Purpose is to store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time;
 2. Recursive name servers - Purpose is to store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time; Perform full DNS reolution requests;
 3. Root name servers
 4. TLD name servers
 5. Authoritative name servers
 
 ->  All domain names in the global DNS system have a TTL/ time to live;
 - Time to Live - (TTL) - A value, in seconds, that can be configured by the owner of a domain name for how long a name server is allowed to cache an entry before it should discard it and perform a full resolution again;
 
 Local Recursive server performs a full recursive resolution
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 1. Contact a root named server; There are 13 Root name servers/ 13 authorities that provide root name lookups as service - responsible for directing queries towards appropriate TLD name servers. They are distributed across the globe via anycast;
   * Anycast - A technique that is used to route traffic to different destination depending on factors like location, congestion, or                    link health;
 
 2. The root servers will respond to a DNS lookup with TLD(Top-level domain - Last part of any domain name - .com/.org/.edu, etc) name server that should be queried;
 3. For each TLD there is a TLD name server / global distribution;
 4. The TLD servers will respond again with a redirect, informing the computer performing the name lookup with what authoritative name server to contact;
 5. The DNS lookup could be redirected at the authoriative server for the respective domain name;
 6. The authoritative server would finally provide the actual IP of the server in question;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* DNS and UDP
---------------
-> DNS is an example of an application layer service that uses UDP for the transport layer instead of TCP;
-> UDP is connectionless - there is no setup or teardown of a connection;

- A single DNS request and its response can fit inside a single UDP datagram - ideal for a connectionless protocol;
- DNS can generate a lot of traffic, caches of DNS entries are stored on local machines and caching name severs, for the full resolution to be processed all lot of traffic will exist;

* Full DNS lookup to take place via TCP
------------------------------------------
1. The host making the DNS resolution request would send a SYN packet to the local name server on port 53 (port DNS - Domain Name System - listens on);
2. The name servers responds with a SYN ACK packet;
3. The original host needs to respond with an ACK in order to complete the three-way handshake - connection has been established;
4. The original host has to send the actual request (IP address for a food accomplice);
5. The name server would respond with another ACK;
6. The caching server needs to talk to root name server to find who is responsible for the.com TLD; (3 way handshake) (opened) Four way handshake  (closed connection) --  process requires 11 packets
- The recursive server has the correct TLD - top-level domain (.com, .edu. org, etc)name server;
7. The recursive server needs to repeat the entire process to discover proper authoritative name servers;  -- requires 11 packets
8. The recursive server repeats the process inorder to get the ip of food.com (TLD);  --- requires 11 packets;
9. The recursive/cachine name server responds to the original host; - 1 packet;
10. The host responds with an ACK confirmation; - 1 packet;
11. Finally the TCP connection needs to be closed - four-way handshake; - 4 packets;


Total packets : 44 packets; (minimum)

* Full DNS lookup to take place via UDP
------------------------------------------
1. The host sends a UDP packet to its local name server on port 53 asking for the IP address for food.com; - 1 packet
2. The local name server acts like a recursive server and sends up a UDP packet to root sever;
3. The root server sends a response containing the proper TLD name server;
4. The recursive name server sends a packet to the TLD server;
5. Receives back a response containing the correct authoritative server;
6. The recursive server sends its final request to the authoritative name server;
7. The Authoritative name server sends a response containing IP for food.com;
8. The recursive name server sends its final request to DNS resolver / host that made the request;

Total -> 8 packets;
(In case it doesn't get the packet, it request again);

* Troubleshoot
----------------
-> Error-detection - The ability for a protocol or a program to determine that something is wrong.
-> Error-recovery - The ability for a protocol or a program to attempt to fix it.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Ping :
-------------------------------------------------
- It is used to communicate any issues faced while connecting or transfer od data.
- Mostly used by routers or remote hosts to communicate why transmission has failed back to the transmitter;

- ICMP consists of 
1. Header - few fields and a data-section - that can be used by the host to figure out which of their transmission generated the error.
    a. Type (8 bits) - specifies the type of messgae being delivered - destination unreachable, time exceeded;
    b. Code (8 bits) - Indicates a more specific reason; destination uinreachable (network, port unreachable);
    c. Checksum (16 bit) - Compare the value to check if the data is not corrupted;
    d. Rest of the header (32 bit) - optional - to send more infor - type / code;
2. Data payload for the ICMP  packet - enables the recipient of the messgae to know which of the transmissions caused the error being reported; (It contains the IP header and the first 8 bytes of data payload section of the offending packet);

Ping -> Tool to useful to detect network issues;
- It lets you send a special type of ICMP message called an Echo Request.
- The Echo Request justs checks if the destination exists;
- If the destination is up and running and able to communicate on the network, it'll send back an ICMP Echo Reply message type;

In the comand line  -> ping 8.8.8.8 -> ping <destination ip/ domain name>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Traceroute
-------------
- A utility that lets you discover the path between two nodes, and gives you information about each hop along the way;
- It works by the manipulation of the TTL field at the IP level;
- For each hop, traceoute sends three identical packets
  - linux and Mac - traceroute google.com  (sends UDP packets to very high port numbers)
  - windows - tracert google.com (displays the ICMP Echo Requests)
 
 Similar tool:
 - mtr - Linux/MacOS  (realtime);
 - pathping - Windows (runs for 50s, and then displays all the aggregate data all at once);
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Testing Port Connectivity
 ----------------------------
 - To test connectivity at the transport layer
    - netcat - Linux/MacOS  -> nc <host> <port>  -> 2 arguments -> nc google.com 80 - tries to establish connection to google.com on port 80;
            nc -z -v google.com 80;
            
    - Test-NetConnection - Windows
        Test-NetConnection google.com -> use an ICMP echo request;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
* Name Resolution Tools 
-------------------------
- nslookup <hostname> -> output - server used to perform the request and resolution result;
In order to identify the IP address of twitter.com

nslookup twitter.com
Output -> A record 
Server
Address

Non-authoritative answer:
Name 
Address
Name Address

Can start an interative session on nslookup by just typing : nslookup
> google.com
> set type=MX
> google.com

> set debug (allows the tool to display the full response of the packets - including intermediary and all their contents(TTL - Zone Files).)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Public DNS Servers
----------------------    
-> An ISP always gives access to a recursive name server as part of the service it provides;
-> Public DNS Servers - Name servers specifically set up so that anyone can use  them for free;
 -> Level 3 communications - ISPs - 4.4.4.1 - 4.4.4.6;
 -> Google public name servers - Ips 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4;
 
 Most public DNS servers are available to be used through anycast;
